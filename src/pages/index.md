          Interacting with digital products and technologies is highly effected
          by the context of use, by a person's emotions and attitudes about
          using a particular product, system or service. I focus on making
          digital systems work in the way users would expect it. This involves
          several disciplines, like marketing channel exploration, customer and
          user journey analytics, information architecture, content strategy,
          usability testing or user experience design

          Sai is exceptionally observant. His deep experience and understanding
          of products landscape is evident in every interaction with him. He is
          not only quick to understand what is being presented but also can
          consistently get a 360 degree view of elements in the projects and the
          teams. He can see several possibilities at the same time and can
          patiently entertain all the ideas while being practical about it. I
          look forward to be associated and learn from him in the future.
          Personally, I am a fan of his keen perception and accurate synthesis.
