          *Products exist to solve pain-points and to address unmet needs of customers.*
          In my experience the best way is to engage, collaborate with customers to
          interpret their business needs, understand their pain-points, uncover
          opportunities and use that to define products for significant impact.
          I develop strategic vision for products taking into account business goals,
          technology, industry landscape and competitive offerings.

          Sai is exceptionally observant. His deep experience and understanding
          of products landscape is evident in every interaction with him. He is
          not only quick to understand what is being presented but also can
          consistently get a 360 degree view of elements in the projects and the
          teams. He can see several possibilities at the same time and can
          patiently entertain all the ideas while being practical about it. I
          look forward to be associated and learn from him in the future.
          Personally, I am a fan of his keen perception and accurate synthesis.
