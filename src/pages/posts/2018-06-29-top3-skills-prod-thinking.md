In 2014 Nina Mufleh moved back to California with the goal of “working at a high impact tech company with a stellar team” after a decade in Middle East . Her successful endeavors in building, running a social media agency with impressive clientele there did not help her in finding the job she wanted in this market.

After sending many applications to companies without any luck, she decided to do something different and very smart — Demonstrate her skills as a marketer to the company she most wanted to work for — Airbnb. So, she created a website [nina4airbnb](http://www.nina4airbnb.com/) to demonstrate among other things, her understanding and data driven assessment of Middle East tourism market for Airbnb (Market Analysis), Why Dubai, compared to other adjacent markets (Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Qatar etc.) is the entry point to this market (Prioritization), Marketing platforms, Partnership opportunities to be successful in the market (Go to Market). All of this using an engaging design experience modeled along Airbnb’s own web experience, clearly to get their attention.

This is a great example of demonstrating one’s skills instead of relying on your impressive resume when seeking out interesting opportunities. See my [previous post here](https://medium.com/@productwonk/how-a-changing-indian-it-industry-is-influencing-product-manager-and-product-leader-hiring-9a24eca1b26f) for more on why this may be becoming more prevalent.

**Business of Products**

Note: I use the term ‘Product’ here to refer to a tangible product or an intangible service that provides value to customers

When you are in the ‘Business of Products’, emphasis is almost always on the ‘Value’. Key elements of this Value management process starts with answering some crucial questions — What problem / unmet needs do you want to address? Whom are you addressing this for ? Why is this important ? Is this a big enough problem to solve ? Here, most problem solvers live in the solutions space and a good Product manager’s job is to get people out of it to focus on problems.

> If I had an hour to solve a problem, I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions. — Albert Einstein

**Show and Tell**

Among the many core skills and soft skills (‘dark arts’) involved in the Business of Products, here is my list of top 3 specific skills to demonstrate Product thinking in no particular order.

Note, the emphasis is on Demonstrability.

1. Market Analysis

Analyzing the market landscape and its current challenges, observing market trends and envisioning opportunities, assessing size of the market and current available alternatives is a core Product thinking skill that lends itself well for demonstration.

Here is one as a sample in the India context — Analysis of ‘Cloud Kitchens’ market and Should Food aggregators (E.g. Swiggy, Zomato) enter this by partnering with likes of FreshMenu or go it alone?

2. Prioritization

Coming up all the possible ideas and ways to address the identified problem / unmet need is where most problem solvers are good at but prioritizing those ideas for value creation using some reasonably objective framework is another critical Product thinking skill that can be easily demonstrated. Prioritization in this context is usually a delicate balance between business objectives, market needs and available resources. This is true whether one looking at a product backlog or prioritizing investments in the business. Applies for a large organization or a startup.

Myntra’s move to ‘App only’ and subsequent U-turn is a good example to analyze various prioritization criteria it applied.

3. Business Case Modeling

A Business Case model enables decision makers and/or financiers to effectively assess and communicate the viability of a Product or initiative including M&A. This is an advanced skill and involves wrapping in numbers (hence its demonstrability).

At the most basic level it involves costs, benefits risks associated with a Product. It combines budgets, key metrics for the business (e.g. Sales volume, GMV, click-throughs, site visits), relevant unit economics combined with top line to estimate return on investment (NPV, IRR or Total Economic Impact).

Design Thinking, Product Strategy, Go-to-Market are equally important skills that can also be demonstrated but I intentionally left these out as these involve a collection of other skills including the above.

> Don’t ignore that expertise. Leverage it.

As Nina Mufleh demonstrated her skills on her web site, she clearly used her design expertise to present it to Airbnb (and the world). The results are stunning. She got global media coverage, millions of social media impressions, 14000+ LinkedIn profile views and pipeline of interviews with dozens of other high impact companies. Interestingly though, she did not join Airbnb.

You may be from Design, Engineering, Project management, Sales, Finance backgrounds or a subject matter expert. So, leverage that expertise and show case that when you are demonstrating your Product thinking.
