Let's face it. Your impressive resume is becoming less relevant when it comes to seeking interesting career opportunities. Technology companies in India are increasingly looking for demonstrable skills and are asking candidates to ‘show and tell’ as part of their hiring process.

> Plural of Anecdote is not data. But…

I can’t say for sure whether this is an observable trend in IT services companies that account for majority of Indian IT sector but it certainly seems to be more prevalent for experienced professionals (10–15 yrs) and for strategic roles like Product Management in MNCs, Startups and IT service companies moving up the value chain to build products.

In the absence of any decent data, I surmise this based on my conversations with several product companies in India that are hiring PMs, friends on their journey of career transition, as well as dozens of distraught experienced Indian IT professionals that I met at some recent conferences [like this one](https://www.productleadership.com/information-session-ipl/).

If you were to look at some relevant trends in Indian IT industry, it is not hard to see why there is and will be less emphasis on resume based hiring but more on demonstrable skills.

**\*-a-thon**

Apart from the core skill areas of Market orientation, Customer empathy, Technical abilities, Business understanding, skills like Persuasion, Influencing, Negotiation, Instincts — all of which I refer to collectively as the dark arts — differentiate an awesome product manager from the rest.

Hack-a-thons, Skill-a-thons, Product-a-thons, <whatever>-a-thon are increasingly used by hiring managers for aspirants to showcase their skills, talents as part of hiring process in a… wait for it… hire-a-thon.

**Growing importance of data and design in decision making.**

Companies are increasingly using data from continuous intake and exhaust of external, internal data sources to decide on what customer pain points, unmet needs to address, add / modify / remove capabilities based on gathered data on acquisition, retention, engagement and other business metrics.

Increased customer & design focus is also seen as a key differentiator by companies. All of this demands a Product Manager to be able to analyze, synthesize and consequently prioritize based on this data, A product manager who can put themselves in the shoes of a customer and designs customer experiences along the path of their journey. Unsurprisingly, companies are seeking PMs who can demonstrate skills, thought process, a structured approach to using data & customer empathy for a given scenario while not losing sight of that strategic view. As you can imagine, a resume is a poor artifact to show case those skills if you already have them. If you don’t it is time to acquire those skills.

**Increasing number of Product Managers in India**

According to this Google-Accel Partners India report , number of Product managers in India is steadily rising from 17000 in 2010 to 36000 in 2015 and projected at 68000 in 2020. While this number seems small given the large number of professionals employed in this industry, it indicates a growing demand for this strategic role in Indian IT companies (MNCs and new age economy startups) and a pool of Product Managers with less average experience (in that role). What better way for companies to compete to hire from that pool via live platforms, events for demonstrating one’s capabilities & skills.

For all the above reasons, hiring managers are going to increasingly judge and hire candidates based on their demonstrable skills and ability to rise to a challenge, think on their feet and use creative approaches to solve a given problem. Something that doesn’t easily come across on a resume. I am convinced that this is not going to be limited to Product managers but even other senior & key roles.

So, if you haven’t already, acquire those demonstrable skills. Tell your story. Establish a digital persona to get noticed. Less time on that flowery resume.
